![61385113ca7d7_e319f0da226515b70f404334528d2fb6](https://github.com/john-ml-dev/Abalone/assets/78201996/b24e841d-9d8a-4c8c-848e-e5c12059a931)


Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description.  The number of rings is the value to predict: either as a continuous value or as a classification problem.

Name | Data Type | Measurement Unit | Description
-----------------------------
Sex | nominal | -- | M, F, and I (infant)
Length | continuous | mm | Longest shell measurement
Diameter | continuous | mm | perpendicular to length
Height | continuous | mm | with meat in shell
Whole weight | continuous | grams | whole abalone
Shucked weight | continuous | grams | weight of meat
Viscera weight | continuous | grams | gut weight (after bleeding)
Shell weight | continuous | grams | after being dried
Rings | integer | -- | +1.5 gives the age in years
